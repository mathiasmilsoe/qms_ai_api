Each sub-requirement has been assessed as follows: \n\n1. **Implement access control mechanisms**: This sub-requirement is graded as partly compliant (PC) due to insufficient documentation of access control mechanisms, particularly regarding two-factor authentication and testing procedures. The relevant documents do not provide comprehensive details on how access is restricted based on user roles. \n\n2. **Ensure secure communication channels**: This sub-requirement is also graded as partly compliant (PC) because the documentation lacks specific details on encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) for secure communication. Furthermore, there is no evidence of security testing related to these channels, which is critical for compliance. \n\n3. **Protect data integrity and confidentiality**: This sub-requirement is graded as partly compliant (PC) due to the presence of an obsolete safety requirements document, which raises concerns about current encryption measures. Additionally, there is insufficient detail on access controls and a lack of evidence for data security assessments, which are necessary to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. \n\nIn summary, while some measures are in place, significant gaps in documentation and testing exist across all sub-requirements, leading to the overall grade of partly compliant.",

The following mechanisms are in place:\n\n1. **User Authentication**: Each user must authenticate using a unique username and password. Passwords must meet the following criteria:\n   - Minimum length of [[number]] characters.\n   - Must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.\n\n2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To enhance security, two-factor authentication is implemented. Users are required to provide a second form of verification, which can be either:\n   - A time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app.\n   - A verification code sent via SMS to the registered mobile number.\n\n3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to the system is restricted based on user roles. The following roles are defined:\n   - **Administrator**: Full access to all system functionalities.\n   - **User**: Limited access to functionalities relevant to their role.\n   - **Guest**: Read-only access to certain data.\n   Access rights are assigned based on the user's role, ensuring that users can only access information necessary for their duties.\n\n4. **Testing of Access Control Mechanisms**: The access control mechanisms, including 2FA, have undergone rigorous testing to ensure their effectiveness. Testing procedures include:\n   - **Penetration Testing**: Conducted by an external security firm to identify vulnerabilities in the access control system.\n   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involving a group of end-users to validate the usability and effectiveness of the access control mechanisms.\n   - **Regular Audits**: Scheduled audits to review access logs and ensure compliance with access control policies.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the access control mechanisms, including the implementation process and testing results, is maintained in the following documents:\n   -  Device v2.0\n   -  2024-04-03 Device Architecture v2.0\n\nThis comprehensive approach to access control ensures compliance with the requirements of MDR (EU) 2017/745 and enhances the overall security of the BladderCare device system."

This documentation will include a summary of the incident, the analysis conducted, and the recommendations for updates to the plan. \n\n3. **Regular Updates**: The incident response plan will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if significant incidents occur. Each update will reflect the lessons learned from past incidents and will be documented in the revision history of the plan. \n\n4. **Integration with PMS and PMCF Plans**: The lessons learned will also be integrated into the Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) plans to ensure that all relevant data informs the incident response strategy. \n\n5. **Responsible Personnel**: The responsibility for overseeing the integration of lessons learned will be assigned to [[name/position]], who will ensure that all updates are communicated to relevant stakeholders and that training is provided as necessary. \n\nThis mechanism will be documented in the  PMS Plan and  PMCF Plan to ensure compliance with MDR requirements."
