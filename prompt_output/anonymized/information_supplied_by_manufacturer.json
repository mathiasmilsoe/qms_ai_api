            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the labeling requirements of the BladderGuard medical device is partly compliant (PC). The assessment reveals several areas of concern: \n1. **Product Name Visibility**: The product name is present but not prominently displayed, leading to potential confusion (PC). \n2. **Intended Purpose**: The intended purpose is described but lacks specificity regarding clinical indications and target populations, which could lead to misuse (PC). \n3. **Manufacturer's Name and Address**: This information is clearly stated and compliant (C). \n4. **Batch/Serial Number**: The absence of a batch number or serial number is a critical non-compliance issue (NC). \n5. **Date of Manufacture**: The label does not include the date of manufacture, which is required (NC). \n6. **Expiry Date**: There is no mention of an expiry date or a statement indicating no expiry date, which is a significant non-compliance (NC). \n7. **Warnings and Precautions**: Some warnings are included, but they are not comprehensive or conspicuous enough (PC). \n8. **Symbols and Safety Information**: The use of obsolete standards raises concerns, leading to a partly compliant status (PC). \n9. **Language Requirements**: While there is some verification, the documentation does not confirm that labels are provided in all necessary languages (PC). \nOverall, the labeling documentation has several critical gaps that need to be addressed to achieve full compliance with the MDR.",

This will assist users in understanding the diagrams without requiring technical expertise. \n\n3. **Provide Contextual Information**: Accompany each diagram with a brief description that explains the function of the depicted components. For instance, 'The BladderCare Device is designed for non-invasive monitoring of bladder health and is made of medical-grade materials.' \n\n4. **Use High-Quality Images**: Ensure that all images are of high resolution and clarity to avoid any ambiguity regarding the components. \n\n5. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**: If any diagrams are overly complex, consider breaking them down into simpler parts or providing multiple views to enhance understanding. \n\nBy implementing these changes, the documentation will provide a clearer understanding of the BladderCare device's components and their functions, thereby improving compliance with MDR requirements."

Ensure the charger is properly connected.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data Collection**  \n   - **Possible Cause:** Poor connection between the BladderCare Unit (BCU) and the components.  \n   - **Solution:** Ensure that the BCU is securely connected to the components. Check for any visible damage or debris in the connection points.\n\n3. **Monitoring Signals Not Detected**  \n   - **Possible Cause:** Incorrect placement of the components or insufficient contact.  \n   - **Solution:** Adjust the position of the components to ensure they are snug against the skin. Clean the skin area where the sensors make contact to improve signal quality.\n\n4. **Device Overheating**  \n   - **Possible Cause:** Extended use or environmental factors.  \n   - **Solution:** Turn off the device and allow it to cool down for at least [[duration]] minutes before resuming use. Avoid using the device in direct sunlight or high-temperature environments.\n\n5. **Data Transfer Issues**  \n   - **Possible Cause:** Faulty USB connection or software issues.  \n   - **Solution:** Check the USB cable for damage and ensure it is properly connected to both the BCU and the computer. Restart the data visualization software and try again.\n\n6. **Skin Irritation or Discomfort**  \n   - **Possible Cause:** Allergic reaction or improper fit of the components.  \n   - **Solution:** Remove the device immediately. If irritation persists, consult a healthcare professional. Ensure the components fit properly and are made of breathable materials.\n\nFor further assistance, please contact BladderCare customer support at [[contact information]]."

For instance, include a labeled diagram showing the correct placement of the device components on the body.\n\n3. **Clear Formatting**: Use bullet points, numbered lists, and headings to break down information into digestible sections. For example, safety warnings should be clearly separated from usage instructions, and each step in the usage process should be numbered for clarity.\n\n4. **User Testing Feedback**: Incorporate feedback from usability testing conducted with potential users, especially those without a medical background. Summarize findings and adjustments made based on this feedback in a dedicated section.\n\n5. **Multilingual Support**: Ensure that the IFU is available in all relevant languages for the markets where the device will be sold. Include a statement indicating the availability of translations.\n\n6. **Accessibility Features**: Consider adding features such as larger print options or audio instructions for users with visual impairments. Include a note in the IFU about these options.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the IFU will be more user-friendly and accessible, thereby improving user comprehension and compliance with the device's intended use."
