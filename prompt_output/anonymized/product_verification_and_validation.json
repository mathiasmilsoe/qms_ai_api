            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the verification and validation planning requirement is partly compliant (PC). Each sub-requirement has been assessed individually, revealing several gaps and non-conformities. The comprehensive verification and validation plan lacks complete acceptance criteria and detailed methodologies, which are critical for ensuring that all verification and validation activities are systematically conducted. Additionally, while some timelines and milestones are present, they are not comprehensive, lacking an overarching project timeline. Risk management considerations are partially integrated, but the verification plan does not explicitly reference these aspects, which is essential for ensuring safety and effectiveness. Lastly, compliance with relevant standards is also partly demonstrated, with notable gaps in documentation and references to applicable standards. Overall, while some elements are present, the documentation does not fully meet the requirements set forth by the MDR, leading to a partly compliant status.",

Each sub-requirement has been evaluated based on the completeness and clarity of the documentation provided. For instance, while design verification testing was conducted, the acceptance criteria for some tests were not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity in compliance evaluation. Additionally, there was a lack of traceability between design inputs and outputs, which is critical for ensuring all requirements are adequately tested. Inspections were performed, but the records lacked detailed checklists and non-conformance reports, which are essential for demonstrating compliance. Design reviews were conducted, yet the documentation did not sufficiently detail meeting minutes or action items, indicating that the reviews may not fully satisfy the requirements. Furthermore, while some test methods were described, they lacked sufficient detail regarding specific procedures and conditions. Lastly, the statistical methods and sample sizes used were not comprehensively detailed, further contributing to the partly compliant status.

For example, 'The electrical safety tests were conducted using the ABC Electrical Safety Analyzer (Model #98765), calibrated on [insert calibration date].'\n   - **Test Conditions**: Describe the environmental conditions under which the tests were performed, such as temperature, humidity, and any other relevant factors. For instance, 'Tests were conducted at a temperature of 22\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C and relative humidity of 50% \u00b1 5%.'\n   - **Procedure**: Provide a step-by-step account of the testing procedure, including any specific protocols followed. For example, 'The device was subjected to a 10-minute continuous operation test followed by a 5-minute cooldown period, repeated for a total of 10 cycles.'\n   - **Data Collection**: Explain how data was collected and analyzed, including any statistical methods used. For example, 'Data was collected using [insert data collection method] and analyzed using [insert statistical software or method].'\n\n2. **Test Reports**: Reference the specific test reports that contain the results of these tests. Ensure that each report includes:\n   - **Summary of Results**: A brief overview of the findings from each test.\n   - **Conclusion**: A statement on whether the device met the specified requirements based on the test results.\n   - **Document Reference**: Include a reference to the document where the full test report can be found, such as 'Refer to BC Test Reports v2.0 for detailed results and analyses.'\n\n3. **Verification Plan**: Ensure that the BC Verification Plan includes a comprehensive outline of all tests planned, including the rationale for their selection, as well as the criteria for success. For example, 'The verification plan outlines that all electrical safety tests must meet the IEC 60601-1 standard, with a pass criterion of no failures during testing.'\n\nBy incorporating these detailed descriptions into the technical documentation, the manufacturer will provide a clear and comprehensive account of the test methods and protocols, thereby enhancing compliance with MDR requirements."

This feature has been designed to minimize user errors by ensuring that feedback is only given in response to user actions, thus reducing cognitive load and potential confusion.\n\n2. **Error Communication Features**: The system shall have features to communicate status and errors to the user (as specified in BCD S-UR005). This includes visual and auditory alerts that are designed to be easily understood by the intended user population, thereby enhancing usability and reducing the likelihood of misuse.\n\n3. **Use-Related Risk Assessments**: A detailed use-related risk assessment has been performed, identifying potential risks associated with user interactions with the device. The assessment includes scenarios of misuse and outlines mitigation strategies that have been implemented in the design of the BladderCareDevice system.\n\n4. **Usability Testing**: The usability test report (BCD Usability Test Report v2.0) documents the results of usability testing conducted with representative users. The testing aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the user feedback and error communication features in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the system meets the usability requirements and minimizes use-related risks.\n\n5. **Continuous Improvement**: The usability evaluation plan (BCD Usability Evaluation Plan v2.0) outlines a framework for ongoing usability assessments and updates based on user feedback and post-market surveillance data. This ensures that any emerging usability issues are promptly addressed, maintaining compliance with MDR requirements.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to human factors engineering ensures that the BladderCareDevice system is designed with the user in mind, effectively mitigating use-related risks and enhancing overall usability.\""

The categorization is based on the potential impact of software failure on patient safety and device performance. \n\n1. **Minor Concern**: Software components that have low impact on safety and performance, where failure would not result in significant risk to users or patients. Validation activities for these components include basic testing and documentation review.\n\n2. **Moderate Concern**: Software components that could potentially lead to moderate risk if they fail. Validation activities for these components involve more rigorous testing, including integration testing and user acceptance testing, to ensure reliability and performance under expected conditions.\n\n3. **Major Concern**: Software components that pose a significant risk to patient safety or device functionality. Validation activities for these components include extensive testing protocols, including stress testing, failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), and formal verification methods to ensure compliance with safety standards.\n\nThe Software Verification Report (Document ID: MD VER240424) and Software Validation Report (Document ID: MD SVR240425) will reflect this differentiation, providing detailed evidence of the validation activities performed for each level of concern, including test results, methodologies, and conclusions drawn from the validation process.

Additionally, the PMS Plan does not clearly link its activities to the PMCF objectives, resulting in a PC grade due to these deficiencies. \n\n3. **Collect real-world evidence to validate the performance of the device in actual use conditions**: While the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of clinical evaluation, it lacks a detailed strategy for systematically collecting real-world evidence.

This should include a review by the quality assurance team to confirm that all links are accurate and that the document meets the requirements of the MDR. Include a revision history section that documents the changes made and the individuals responsible for the updates.\n\n3. **Documentation of Verification Evidence**: Each entry in the traceability matrix should include a reference to the specific verification protocol used, including acceptance criteria and the results obtained.

This assessment will consider:\n   - The intended use of the device\n   - Any associated risks and hazards\n   - Compliance with applicable regulations and standards\n   - The need for re-validation or additional testing\n\n3. **Documentation**: All assessments and decisions regarding changes will be documented in the Change Management Log. This log will include:\n   - The date of the assessment\n   - The personnel involved in the assessment\n   - The conclusions drawn from the impact assessment\n   - Any required actions or follow-up tasks\n\n4. **Validation**: If a change is deemed significant, a validation plan will be developed to confirm that the change does not adversely affect the device's safety and performance. Validation activities may include:\n   - Re-testing of the device\n   - Review of clinical data\n   - Updates to risk management documentation\n\n5. **Approval**: All changes must be approved by the designated Change Control Board (CCB) before implementation. The CCB will consist of representatives from quality assurance, regulatory affairs, and relevant technical departments.\n\n6. **Implementation**: Once approved, changes will be implemented according to the established timelines. Affected documentation, including the Quality Management System (QMS) documents, will be updated accordingly.\n\n7. **Review and Monitoring**: Post-implementation, the effects of the change will be monitored to ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved and that no new risks are introduced. Any issues identified during this monitoring phase will be addressed promptly.\n\n8. **Training**: Relevant personnel will receive training on the changes made to ensure compliance with updated procedures and practices.\n\nThis comprehensive change management procedure is critical to maintaining the integrity of the BladderTech device and ensuring ongoing compliance with the MDR requirements."

Each CRF must include:\n   - Description of the change\n   - Rationale for the change\n   - Date of the change\n   - Identification of the person responsible for the change\n   - Reference to the affected documents and processes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Changes**: Each proposed change will undergo an assessment process to evaluate its impact on the safety and performance of the device. This assessment will include:\n   - Risk analysis according to ISO 14971:2019/A11:2021\n   - Evaluation of the change against the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) outlined in Annex I of the MDR.\n   - Consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs teams.\n\n3. **Validation of Changes**: Following the assessment, changes that are deemed significant must be validated through appropriate verification and validation activities. This includes:\n   - Conducting necessary tests and evaluations as per the Verification Plan (refer to BladderTech VER240403-01 Verification Plan v2.0).\n   - Documenting the results in a Re-validation Report, which will include:\n     - Summary of validation activities\n     - Results and conclusions drawn from the validation process\n     - Any necessary corrective actions taken.\n\n4. **Record Keeping**: All documentation related to change management, including CRFs, assessment reports, and validation reports, shall be maintained in the Quality Management System (QMS) and made available for review during audits.\n\n5. **Review and Approval**: Changes must be reviewed and approved by the designated Change Control Board (CCB) prior to implementation. The CCB will consist of representatives from Quality Assurance, Regulatory Affairs, and relevant technical departments.\n\n6. **Training and Communication**: All personnel involved in the change management process will receive training on these procedures to ensure understanding and compliance. Changes will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders in a timely manner.\n\nBy implementing these procedures, we ensure that all changes are adequately evaluated and documented, thereby maintaining compliance with MDR requirements."

This plan will be reviewed and approved by the management team.\n\n2. **Conducting Audits**: Audits will be performed at regular intervals, and at least annually, to assess the effectiveness of the verification and validation processes. The auditor will review relevant documentation, including the Verification Plan (MDX BLI240403-01), Final Verification Report (MDX BFR240424), Test Reports, Validation Plan (MDX BAP240403), and Final Validation Report (MDX BAR240425).\n\n3. **Audit Reports**: After each audit, a comprehensive audit report will be generated, detailing findings, observations, and recommendations for corrective actions. This report will be submitted to the management team for review and action.\n\n4. **Corrective Actions**: Any non-conformities identified during the audits will be documented, and a corrective action plan will be developed and implemented to address these issues promptly.\n\n5. **Follow-up Audits**: Follow-up audits will be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken.\n\n6. **Documentation**: All audit reports and corrective action plans will be maintained as part of the quality management system documentation and will be made available for review by the notified body upon request.\"\n\nThis process will ensure that independent reviews and audits are comprehensive and demonstrate compliance with the MDR requirements."
