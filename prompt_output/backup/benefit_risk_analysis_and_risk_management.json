Each sub-requirement has been assessed as follows: \n\n1. **Intended Benefits**: The documentation identifies some intended benefits, such as objective data acquisition for muscular performance, but lacks comprehensive details on clinical outcomes and operational efficiencies. This results in a 'Partly Compliant' (PC) grade due to incomplete documentation of intended benefits. \n\n2. **Potential Risks**: The risk management plan identifies several potential risks but lacks detailed descriptions of mitigation strategies and residual risks. This leads to a 'Partly Compliant' (PC) grade as not all risks are adequately documented. \n\n3. **Benefit-Risk Analysis**: The analysis outlines risks and benefits but lacks quantitative assessments to support the qualitative conclusions, resulting in a 'Partly Compliant' (PC) grade. \n\n4. **Conclusions of the Analysis**: The conclusions are documented but lack comprehensive detail on uncertainties and assumptions, leading to another 'Partly Compliant' (PC) grade. \n\nOverall, the documentation demonstrates an effort to address the benefit-risk analysis but falls short in several critical areas, particularly in providing comprehensive details and quantitative support, which are essential for full compliance with MDR requirements.",

This analysis will include:\n   - Evaluation of adverse events and their impact on device safety and performance.\n   - Identification of new hazards and updating the Risk Management File (RMF) accordingly.\n\n3. **Indicators and Thresholds**: Specific indicators and threshold values will be established to facilitate continuous reassessment of the benefit-risk analysis and risk management processes.\n\n4. **Complaint Investigation**: Effective methods and tools will be employed to investigate complaints and analyze market-related experiences. This will include protocols for establishing statistically significant increases in the frequency or severity of incidents.\n\n5. **Communication Protocols**: Clear methods and protocols will be developed for communication with competent authorities, notified bodies, economic operators, and users regarding any identified risks or necessary corrective actions.\n\n6. **Corrective Actions**: Systematic procedures will be in place to identify and initiate appropriate measures, including corrective actions, based on the findings from the PMS activities.\n\n7. **Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)**: A PMCF plan will be implemented as part of the PMS activities, ensuring that any new clinical data is collected and assessed to inform the ongoing safety and performance evaluation of the device.\n\n8. **Documentation and Reporting**: All findings from the PMS activities will be documented in a Post-Market Surveillance Report, which will be reviewed at least annually or as specified in the PMS Plan. This report will include updates to the Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) as necessary.\n\nThis comprehensive PMS Plan is aligned with the requirements of Article 84 of the MDR and is intended to ensure that clinical risks associated with the Paragit PX device are effectively monitored and managed throughout its lifecycle."

The Risk Management File, including the Risk Management Plan and Risk Management Report, is organized in a clear and logical manner, allowing for easy navigation and retrieval of documents. \n\n2. All documents are stored in a centralized digital repository, accessible via secure links: \n   - Risk Management Plan: [insert link to the Risk Management Plan] \n   - Risk Management Report: [insert link to the Risk Management Report] \n\n3. Access protocols have been established to ensure that authorized personnel can retrieve the Risk Management File upon request. This includes a designated point of contact for regulatory inquiries and a process for timely provision of requested documents. \n\n4. Regular audits of the document storage and access protocols will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with accessibility requirements as outlined in the MDR. \n\n5. The Risk Management File will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect any changes in risk management activities or regulatory requirements, ensuring that it remains current and comprehensive. \n\nBy implementing these measures, we confirm that the Risk Management File is readily accessible and available for review by regulatory authorities, thereby meeting the compliance requirements of MDR (EU) 2017/745."
