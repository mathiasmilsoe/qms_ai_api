            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the technical documentation of the ParagitPX medical device is 'Partly Compliant' (PC). Each sub-requirement has been assessed as follows:\n\n1. **Clear and Organized Documentation (PC)**: The documentation is structured but lacks clarity in navigation and comprehensibility. There is no clear navigation guide, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, technical jargon is not sufficiently explained, which may hinder understanding for non-expert users.\n\n2. **Searchability (PC)**: While the documentation includes a table of contents, it lacks a built-in search function or indexed keywords, making it difficult for users to quickly find specific information. This limits the usability of the documentation.\n\n3. **Unambiguity (PC)**: The documentation is generally well-organized but lacks specificity in the intended purpose and operational parameters of the device. Some technical specifications are referenced but not fully detailed, leading to potential misinterpretation of the device's capabilities.\n\nOverall, while the documentation meets some requirements, significant gaps in clarity, searchability, and specificity prevent it from being fully compliant with the MDR standards.",

It is housed in a durable PA2200 Nylon casing that protects the sensitive electronics within. \n\n2. **Paragit Sleeve (PS)**: A non-intrusive, textile-based sleeve embedded with EMG sensors, designed for comfortable wear on either upper or lower limbs. The sleeve is made from breathable, stretchable, and washable fabric, available in various sizes, and incorporates conductive yarn and polymer to ensure optimal signal capture. \n\n3. **Paragit Electrode Adapter (PEA)**: A 3D-printed adapter that facilitates the connection of the PRU to standard electrodes, maintaining a fixed inter-electrode distance for accurate readings. \n\n4. **Paragit Flex Adapter (PFA)**: Another 3D-printed adapter that allows flexible connections between the PRU and wired electrodes, enhancing usability in various research settings. \n\nThe ParagitPX operates by first connecting the PRU to either the sleeve or an adapter. Users wear the device according to the provided instructions, after which it begins collecting data on muscle activation and movement patterns. This data can be extracted via a USB connection for further analysis using compatible data processing software. \n\nThe intended purpose of the ParagitPX is to serve as a research tool for athletes, healthcare professionals, and sports enthusiasts, providing objective and quantitative insights into muscle performance and movement dynamics.

The sleeve is designed to be non-intrusive and is made from breathable, stretchable, and washable fabric, ensuring comfort during use.\n\n3. **Data Collection**: Once the device is worn as instructed and activated, it begins to collect and store relevant data on muscle activity, movement patterns, and skin impedance. The data collection process is facilitated by the embedded sensors within the PRU, which continuously monitor and record bio-signals.\n\n4. **Data Extraction and Transfer**: After data collection, the device can be connected to a computer via a USB port for data extraction. This allows for the transfer of collected data to external software for further analysis.\n\n5. **Data Visualization and Analysis**: The extracted data can be uploaded to any compatible data processing software for visualization and analysis, enabling users to interpret the results effectively.\n\nThe underlying technologies include advanced signal processing algorithms that interpret the collected data, ensuring accurate representation of muscle activation and movement dynamics.

The software is designed for investigative use only, meaning that any failure will not lead to serious injury or damage to health.

This classification is justified based on the following risk analysis:\n\n1. **Intended Use**: The ParagitPX is designed solely for the collection of signals related to muscle activity and movement for research purposes. It does not provide diagnostic or therapeutic functions, thereby mitigating the potential for serious harm.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment**: A comprehensive risk assessment was conducted in accordance with EN ISO 14971:2019/A11:2021. The identified risks associated with the device's operation, such as skin irritation or allergic reactions to materials, are classified as non-serious injuries. The risk management process confirmed that all risks are acceptable after implementing appropriate risk control measures.\n\n3. **Control Measures**: The device incorporates safety features and user instructions that minimize risks during use. The software's failure does not lead to unacceptable risk, as it is designed to be non-invasive and does not affect critical health functions.\n\n4. **Rationale for Class A Classification**: Given that the device does not contribute to a hazardous situation resulting in unacceptable risk, and considering the nature of its intended use, it is appropriately classified as Class A. This classification aligns with the definitions and rules outlined in the MDR and is supported by the risk management documentation provided in PX Annex 05 - Benefit-Risk Analysis and Risk Management.\n\nIn conclusion, the classification of ParagitPX as Class A is substantiated by a thorough risk analysis and adherence to the applicable regulatory requirements. This classification ensures that the device is subject to appropriate risk management strategies while maintaining compliance with the MDR."

It is equipped with advanced sensors for electromyography (EMG), movement detection (IMU), and skin impedance measurement. The PRU operates by utilizing the following principles:\n- **Electromyography Sensors**: These sensors detect electrical activity produced by muscle cells when these cells are activated. The PRU processes these signals to provide real-time feedback on muscle activation levels.\n- **Movement Sensors**: The integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) captures data on acceleration and angular velocity, allowing for detailed analysis of movement patterns.\n- **Impedance Measurement**: This feature assesses the skin's impedance to ensure optimal contact between the electrodes and the skin, enhancing signal quality.\n\nThe PRU is housed in a durable PA2200 Nylon casing, which protects the internal electronics while maintaining a lightweight design for user comfort. It connects seamlessly with the Paragit Sleeve and adapters, ensuring efficient data transfer and power management.\n\n#### Paragit Sleeve (PS)\nThe Paragit Sleeve is a non-intrusive, textile-based garment designed for wearability on the upper or lower limbs. Key features include:\n- **Material Composition**: Made from breathable, stretchable, and washable fabric, the sleeve is designed for comfort during extended use. It incorporates conductive yarn and polymer to facilitate effective signal transmission from the EMG sensors.\n- **Size Variability**: Available in multiple sizes to accommodate different users, ensuring a snug fit that enhances data accuracy.\n\n#### Paragit Electrode Adapter (PEA)\nThe Paragit Electrode Adapter is a 3D-printed component that connects the PRU to external electrodes. It is engineered to maintain a fixed distance between electrodes, which is crucial for accurate EMG readings. The adapter's design ensures compatibility with various commercially available medical-grade electrodes, enhancing the versatility of the ParagitPX system.\n\n#### Paragit Flex Adapter (PFA)\nThe Paragit Flex Adapter allows for flexible connections between the PRU and wired electrodes. This adapter is also 3D printed from PA2200 material, ensuring durability while providing the necessary flexibility for different electrode placements. It is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional fixed connections may be impractical.\n\n### Conclusion\nThese detailed descriptions of the functional elements of the ParagitPX device clarify the roles and interactions of each component, ensuring that users understand the device's capabilities and limitations."
