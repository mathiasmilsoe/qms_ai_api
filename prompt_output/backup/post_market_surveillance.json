            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the Post-Market Surveillance System is 'Partly Compliant' (PC) due to several identified gaps across the sub-requirements. The PMS plan and PMCF plan are documented and outline responsibilities, but they lack sufficient detail in critical areas. For instance, there are insufficient data analysis protocols, which are essential for effective post-market surveillance. The PMS plan does not adequately describe how data from customer complaints and adverse events will be analyzed, nor does it provide clear corrective action procedures. Additionally, while the integration of the ParagitPX device into the manufacturer's quality management system is mentioned, there is a lack of evidence for continuous monitoring and insufficient detail on quality management processes. Furthermore, the documentation does not specify a clear timeline for data analysis or how user feedback will be systematically collected and analyzed. Lastly, while there is a framework for preventive and corrective actions, the lack of monitoring procedures and insufficient detail on corrective actions further contribute to the 'Partly Compliant' status.",

Firstly, the documentation lacks a comprehensive summary of results and conclusions derived from post-market surveillance data, which is critical for compliance with MDR requirements. The PMS Plan and PMCF Plan do not effectively summarize findings or actionable insights, leading to a non-conformity regarding the lack of summary of results. Secondly, while some rationale and descriptions of preventive and corrective actions are included, the Traceability Matrix and Verification Plan do not provide sufficient detail on specific actions taken in response to identified risks. This indicates that while there is some compliance, it is not comprehensive. Lastly, although there is a post-market surveillance plan in place, there is no clear evidence of regular updates or a systematic process for making these reports available to the competent authority upon request, leading to further non-conformities.
