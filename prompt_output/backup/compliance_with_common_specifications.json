The assessment of the sub-requirements reveals that while there is a reasonable effort to comply with the relevant common specifications (CS), significant gaps remain. For the first sub-requirement, the documentation shows a reasonable effort in testing activities but lacks detailed methodologies and comprehensive evidence of compliance testing results, which are critical for demonstrating compliance. The second sub-requirement highlights a lack of explicit justifications for deviations from CS, which is necessary to ensure that alternative solutions maintain equivalent safety and performance. Lastly, the documentation for compliance with CS for products listed in Annex XVI shows that while the device is classified appropriately, there are insufficient details regarding risk management and post-market surveillance activities. Overall, the documentation needs to be enhanced to provide clearer evidence and justifications for compliance with CS.",

For instance, while the 'PX Summary of Technical Documentation (STED) v2.0' outlines the device's intended purpose and general safety requirements, it lacks comprehensive evidence of conformity with all applicable harmonised standards and CS. Additionally, the 'PX GSPR Checklist Final v2.0' does not adequately address all performance requirements, which raises concerns regarding the completeness of the risk management and clinical evaluation processes.

While a checklist exists, it lacks detailed results from specific tests, particularly in usability and risk management, which are critical for demonstrating compliance with the MDR. \n\n2. **Ensure technical documentation complies with CS**: This sub-requirement is also graded as partly compliant. The technical documentation is organized according to the STED format and includes necessary annexes, but it contains obsolete documents and lacks detailed methodologies in the clinical evaluation report. The presence of outdated documents could lead to inconsistencies in compliance status. \n\n3. **Conduct clinical evaluation and post-market clinical follow-up in accordance with CS**: This sub-requirement is graded as partly compliant as well. The clinical evaluation report indicates a comprehensive assessment, but it lacks a detailed post-market clinical follow-up plan, which is essential for ongoing compliance. The absence of a clearly defined PMCF plan limits the ability to ensure that the device continues to meet safety and performance standards after market entry. \n\nOverall, while there are efforts to comply with the MDR, significant gaps in documentation and processes prevent full compliance, necessitating further action to address these issues.",

A comprehensive list of identified risks is documented in the Risk Management File (RMF).\n\n2. **Risk Evaluation**: Each identified risk was evaluated based on its likelihood of occurrence and the severity of its consequences. This evaluation is detailed in the risk analysis table included in the RMF.\n\n3. **Risk Control Measures**: For each identified risk, appropriate control measures were implemented. The effectiveness of these measures was verified through testing and validation activities, as outlined in Annex 6 - Product Verification and Validation. The results of these tests demonstrate that the risks have been reduced to acceptable levels.\n\n4. **Residual Risk Assessment**: After implementing the control measures, a residual risk assessment was performed to ensure that the remaining risks are acceptable when weighed against the benefits of the device. This assessment is documented in the RMF, which includes a justification for the acceptability of the residual risks.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Review**: The risk management process is ongoing, with regular reviews and updates conducted as part of the post-market surveillance activities. Any new risks identified during the lifecycle of the device will be documented and addressed accordingly.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that all identified risks are managed effectively, and the safety and performance of the ParagitPX device are maintained throughout its lifecycle.\""

The methodologies employed included:\n\n1. **Literature Search Protocol**: A comprehensive literature search was performed using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, focusing on peer-reviewed articles relevant to the use of electromyography (EMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) technologies in assessing muscular performance and movement. The search strategy included specific keywords related to the intended use of the Paragit PX device.\n\n2. **Data Selection Criteria**: Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure relevance and quality. Only studies that provided clinical data on similar devices or methodologies were included in the analysis.\n\n3. **Data Extraction and Analysis**: Data from the selected studies were extracted systematically, focusing on safety, performance, and clinical outcomes. A qualitative synthesis of the data was performed to assess the overall clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the Paragit PX.\n\n4. **Benefit-Risk Assessment**: A benefit-risk analysis was conducted based on the collected clinical data, evaluating the potential benefits of the device against any associated risks. This assessment was aligned with the requirements set forth in Annex I of the MDR.\n\n5. **Expert Review**: The clinical evaluation was reviewed by qualified experts in the field to ensure the methodologies and conclusions drawn were robust and scientifically valid.\n\nThis detailed methodology provides a clear framework for the clinical evaluation process and supports the conclusions regarding the safety and performance of the Paragit PX device.\""

Objectives\nThe primary objective of the clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Paragit PX device in accordance with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The investigation aims to collect clinical data that supports the intended use of the device and its effectiveness in quantifying muscular performance and movement.\n\n#### 2. Methodology\nThe clinical investigation will be conducted as a multi-center, prospective study involving [[number]] participants across [[number]] sites. The study will include the following phases:\n- **Phase 1**: Participant recruitment and screening.\n- **Phase 2**: Baseline assessments and device application.\n- **Phase 3**: Data collection during device usage, including [[specific metrics to be measured]].\n- **Phase 4**: Follow-up assessments at [[specify time intervals]].\n\n#### 3. Timelines\nThe clinical investigation is expected to commence on [[start date]] and conclude by [[end date]]. Key milestones include:\n- **Ethics approval**: [[date]]\n- **Participant recruitment completion**: [[date]]\n- **Final data collection**: [[date]]\n- **Data analysis and reporting**: [[date]]\n\n#### 4. Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)\nA comprehensive PMCF plan will be established to ensure ongoing monitoring of the device's safety and performance post-market. The PMCF will include:\n- Regular collection of clinical data from users to identify any emerging risks or adverse events.\n- Analysis of feedback from users and healthcare professionals.\n- Periodic review of relevant scientific literature and clinical registries.\n- Reporting of findings in a PMCF evaluation report, which will be integrated into the clinical evaluation report.\n\n#### 5. Compliance and Reporting\nAll clinical investigations will be conducted in compliance with the applicable clinical investigation standards and guidelines. Results will be documented and reported in accordance with the requirements of the MDR, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the investigation process.\n\nThis plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect any changes in regulatory requirements or clinical practice."
