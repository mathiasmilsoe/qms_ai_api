            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the 'Design and Manufacture for Usability' requirement is 'Partly Compliant' (PC). Each sub-requirement has been assessed based on the documentation provided. \n\n1. **Consider the technical knowledge, experience, education, and training of the intended users**: This sub-requirement received a PC grade due to outdated user needs documentation and insufficient consideration of user training. The obsolete document on clinician user needs does not reflect current requirements, and the usability requirements documents lack comprehensive details on user training needs. \n\n2. **Ensure the device can be used safely and accurately by the intended user**: This sub-requirement also received a PC grade. While there is a comprehensive overview of intended use and safety measures, the usability tests do not adequately cover varied user environments, which is critical for ensuring safety and accuracy. \n\n3. **Reduce the risk of user error**: This sub-requirement received a PC grade as well. Although there are efforts to minimize user error through usability testing and clear instructions, the Instructions for Use (IFU) lack sufficient clarity on interpreting device feedback, and user feedback integration is inadequate. \n\nOverall, while there are efforts made towards usability, significant gaps remain in user training considerations, usability testing across diverse environments, and clarity in user instructions, leading to the 'Partly Compliant' grade.",

This can be achieved by adding a section titled 'User Insights' that summarizes common user challenges and the solutions implemented in the device design and instructions. For instance, if users reported confusion regarding a specific function, detail how the instructions have been modified to address this.\n\n3. **Training Recommendations**: Add a subsection under 'User Training' that outlines recommended training sessions or resources for users to familiarize themselves with the device. This could include links to video tutorials, FAQs, or contact information for customer support. \n\n4. **Visual Aids**: Enhance the IFU with additional diagrams, screenshots, or icons that illustrate key functions and error messages. Each visual should be accompanied by a brief description to ensure users can easily understand the context.\n\n5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Introduce a feedback mechanism within the IFU, encouraging users to report any difficulties or suggestions for improvement.

It is equipped with sensors that are calibrated to operate effectively in both bright and dim environments. The user interface has been tested for visibility and usability in different lighting scenarios, ensuring that users can easily interact with the device regardless of ambient light levels.\n\n2. **Noise Levels**: The device's operation is not significantly affected by ambient noise levels. However, it is recommended that users operate the device in environments where excessive noise (e.g., above [[insert decibel level]]) is minimized to ensure clear communication and feedback during use. The device has been tested in various noise environments to confirm its reliability.\n\n3. **Space Constraints**: The design of the ParagitPX device takes into account the need for adequate space for operation. It is compact and lightweight, making it suitable for use in confined spaces such as clinics or sports facilities. Users are advised to ensure that there is sufficient space for the device's components to function effectively, particularly when connecting to other equipment.\n\nThis environmental assessment will be included in the technical documentation to demonstrate compliance with the MDR requirements regarding the intended use of the device in real-world applications."
