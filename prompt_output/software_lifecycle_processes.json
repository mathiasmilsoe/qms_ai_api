            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade is partly compliant (PC) due to several identified gaps across the sub-requirements. While the documentation indicates a structured approach to software development, risk management, verification and validation, information security, configuration management, maintenance procedures, and user training, each area has notable deficiencies. For instance, the Software Development Plan lacks a clearly defined lifecycle model, and the risk management documentation does not fully integrate post-market surveillance data. Additionally, verification documentation is incomplete, usability testing results are missing, and there are insufficient procedures for security testing and change tracking. These gaps indicate that while some compliance measures are in place, they are not comprehensive enough to meet the full requirements of the MDR.",

This analysis will include the evaluation of any new hazards identified and the effectiveness of existing risk control measures. \n\n3. **Integration into Risk Management**: The findings from the post-market surveillance data analysis will be integrated into the risk management documentation. This will involve updating the risk management report and risk analysis to reflect any new risks or changes in the risk profile of the device. \n\n4. **Review and Update**: The risk management documentation will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant new information arises. This will ensure that the risk management process remains dynamic and responsive to real-world data. \n\n5. **Communication**: Effective communication protocols will be established to inform relevant stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, of any significant findings from the post-market surveillance activities. \n\nThis process will be documented in the updated Risk Management Report (MD 2024-04-01 Risk Management Report v3.0) and will ensure that the integration of post-market surveillance data is aligned with the requirements set forth in MDR Article 83 and Annex III."

Although user experience testing was performed, the documentation is missing comprehensive records of repeated evaluations, which are vital for demonstrating stable functionality. \n\n2. **Ensure software dependability under standard and fault conditions**: This sub-requirement is also graded as PC. While the software validation report confirms successful evaluations, it does not sufficiently address fault tolerance strategies, which are essential for dependability under fault conditions. \n\n3. **Validate software functionality against intended application**: The compliance grade is PC here as well. The documentation presents a structured validation strategy, but there are deficiencies in functionality testing outcomes and user feedback documentation, which are necessary to fully validate the software's functionality. \n\n4. **Ensure interoperability and compatibility with other systems**: This sub-requirement is graded as PC due to a lack of evidence from actual interoperability evaluations and compatibility assessments with external systems, despite a clear functional requirement being established. \n\nOverall, while there is a structured approach to compliance, the gaps in testing, documentation, and evidence of functionality under various conditions hinder full compliance with the MDR requirements.",

In the event of a detected error, the system automatically initiates corrective actions to restore normal operation.\n\n2. **Graceful Degradation**: In scenarios where a component fails, the software is designed to maintain essential functionalities. For instance, if the primary data acquisition module fails, the system will switch to a backup module, ensuring continuous operation without significant data loss.\n\n3. **Redundant Systems**: The architecture includes redundant pathways for critical data flows. This redundancy allows the system to reroute data through alternative pathways in case of a fault, thereby minimizing the impact on performance.\n\n4. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: The software is equipped with fail-safe protocols that automatically engage in the event of a critical failure. This includes shutting down non-essential functions to preserve core operations, ensuring patient safety and data integrity.\n\n5. **Regular System Health Checks**: The software performs periodic health checks to assess the operational status of all components. Any anomalies detected during these checks trigger alerts and initiate predefined recovery procedures.\n\n6. **User Alerts and Notifications**: In the event of a fault condition, the software provides real-time alerts to users, informing them of the issue and suggesting corrective actions. This feature enhances user awareness and facilitates timely interventions.\n\nThese strategies are documented in the DX Software v2.0 and are validated through the DX VER240424 Software Verification report, ensuring compliance with the requirements set forth in the MDR for maintaining software dependability under fault conditions. For further details, please refer to the associated documents: DX Software v2.0 and DX VER240424 Software Verification report."

The following points outline our approach:\n\n1. **Display Size and Resolution**: The software has been designed to adapt dynamically to various display sizes and resolutions. This ensures that all interface elements are displayed correctly and are easily accessible on devices with different display characteristics. We have conducted a thorough analysis of common medical device resolutions and implemented responsive design principles to accommodate these variations.\n\n2. **User Interface**: Given the reliance on user interfaces in medical devices, we have optimized all interactive elements for user input. This includes ensuring that buttons and controls are of adequate size and spacing to prevent accidental touches. Usability testing has confirmed that users can interact with the software effectively without frustration.\n\n3. **Usability Testing**: The usability evaluations conducted as part of the MD Usability Test Report v2.0 specifically included scenarios involving medical devices. Feedback from these tests has been integrated into the design to address any identified usability challenges. Detailed results from these evaluations can be found in the MD Usability Test Report v2.0, which outlines how the software design has been adapted for medical use cases.\n\n4. **User Safety and Effectiveness**: We have assessed the unique usability challenges presented by medical devices and have implemented design solutions to mitigate risks associated with these challenges. This includes ensuring that critical information is easily accessible and that navigation is intuitive, thereby enhancing user safety and the overall effectiveness of the software.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the relevant sections in the MD Software v2.0 and MD Usability Test Report v2.0 documents."

This bandwidth should be available at all times during operation.\n\n2. **Latency Requirements**: A maximum latency of [[maximum latency in milliseconds]] is recommended to maintain the responsiveness of the device. Latency exceeding this threshold may result in delays that could affect the accuracy of the data collected.\n\n3. **Connectivity Requirements**: The device must be connected to a stable network with a minimum uptime of [[minimum uptime percentage]] to ensure continuous operation. Any interruptions in connectivity may lead to data loss or corruption.\n\n4. **Network Security**: It is essential that the network complies with the latest cybersecurity standards to protect patient data and ensure the integrity of the device operation. This includes the implementation of firewalls, encryption protocols, and regular security audits.\n\n5. **Performance Testing**: Prior to deployment, network performance testing should be conducted to validate that the above requirements are met.
