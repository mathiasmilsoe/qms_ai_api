            "detailed_compliance_explanation": "The overall compliance grade for the technical documentation of the BladderGuard medical device is 'Partly Compliant' (PC). Each sub-requirement has been assessed as follows:\n\n1. **Clear and Organized Documentation (PC)**: The documentation is structured but lacks clarity in navigation and comprehensibility. There is no clear navigation guide, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, technical jargon is not sufficiently explained, which may hinder understanding for non-expert users.\n\n2. **Searchability (PC)**: While the documentation includes a table of contents, it lacks a built-in search function or indexed keywords, making it difficult for users to quickly find specific information. This limits the usability of the documentation.\n\n3. **Unambiguity (PC)**: The documentation is generally well-organized but lacks specificity in the intended purpose and operational parameters of the device. Some technical specifications are referenced but not fully detailed, leading to potential misinterpretation of the device's capabilities.\n\nOverall, while the documentation meets some requirements, significant gaps in clarity, searchability, and specificity prevent it from being fully compliant with the MDR standards.",
