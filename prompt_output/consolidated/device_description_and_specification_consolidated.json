The PX Intended Purpose v4.0 outlines intended users but fails to specify training requirements, also leading to a partly compliant status. The PX Instructions For Use v4.0 explicitly states the product name 'ParagitPX', which is compliant. However, the draft status of the PX Product Label v2.1 indicates that it does not meet the necessary requirements for marketing. The EU Declaration of Conformity is fully compliant, clearly identifying intended users. Overall, the requirement is partly met due to the lack of detailed alternative identifiers and specific training requirements. Non-compliance in these areas can lead to regulatory scrutiny, potential market access issues, and increased liability risks.
